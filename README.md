# Cryptography.Obfuscation
Obfuscator is a C# library that converts a non-negative integer into *8-character string*, generating a result similar to YouTube video id. Put it simply, this library converts a numeric id such as 127 to xVrAndNb and back.

Preface
------
Obfuscation is not designed to to replace your authentication layer, but simply to provide an additional security step. Ideally, your application should be able to authenticate request without, for example, masking/obfuscating id in the query string.

Install
------
```
Install-Package Kent.Cryptography.Obfuscation
```

Obfuscator 2.0
------
Obfuscator 2.0 uses a slightly different algorithm compared to version 1.0. New algorithm is introduced to achieve true constant mode across all .NET versions. Prior to version 2.0, constant mode will still achieve expected result as long as you don't change the target framework of your project. If you have been using version 1.0.1 and finds this limitation acceptable, it's safe not to upgrade.

Usage
------
### Basic Example
Provides unique *id <> string mapping* which will not change unless Seed value is changed.
```
  var obfuscator = new Obfuscator();
  string obfuscatedID = obfuscator.Obfuscate(15);   // e.g. xVrAndNb
  
  // Reverse-process:
  int deobfuscatedID = obfusactor.Deobfuscate(obfuscatedID);  // 15
```

### Randomized Mode
Generates randomized sequence which will cause the *Obfuscate* function to generate different values even when obfuscating the same id.
```
  var obfuscator = new Obfuscator();
  obfuscator.Strategy = ObfuscationStrategy.Randomized;
  
  // 'randomized' to generate different sequence for the same id.
  string obfuscatedID = obfuscator.Obfuscate(15);         // e.g. MzQgC4rL
  string secondObfuscatedID = obfuscator.Obfuscate(15);   // e.g. 4sucAs0D
  
  // Reverse-process:
  int deobfuscatedID = obfusactor.Deobfuscate(obfuscatedID);    // 15
  deobfuscatedID = obfusactor.Deobfuscate(secondObfuscatedID);  // 15
```

### Seed Value
Seed value is the 'differentiator' that makes *id <> string mapping* unique to your application. It is highly recommended to set this value rather than depending on the default value set by the library (which is 113).
```
  var obfuscator = new Obfuscator();
  obfuscator.Seed = 167;
  string obfuscatedID = obfuscator.Obfuscate(15);
```
**Note**: Minimum seed value is 2 and it's recommended to set this value to varying digits (instead of something like 100), as this will be used in XOR operations. Some example of recommended seed values are 113, 167, 73, etc.
